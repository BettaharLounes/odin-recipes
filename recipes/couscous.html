<p>
Chicken with couscous is a simple yet flavorful dish made with tender chicken cooked in aromatic spices like cumin and paprika. It’s often paired with vegetables such as carrots or zucchini.
</p>

<p>
The couscous, light and fluffy, soaks up the savory juices from the chicken. This dish is both comforting and rooted in North African culinary traditions.

<ul>
<li> <h3>Ingredients </h3>  </li>
<li> 3 ¼ cups low-sodium chicken broth, divided  </li>
<li> 1 cup quick-cooking couscous  </li>
<li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided  </li>
<li>  4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into cubes  </li>
<li>  salt and ground black pepper to taste   </li>
<li> 1 carrot, thinly sliced</li>
<li>  ½ cup finely chopped jalapeno chile peppers</li>
<li> 1 zucchini, diced</li>
<li>  3 green onions, thinly sliced   </li>
<li> 1 ½ teaspoons grated fresh ginger root         </li>
<li>   ½ teaspoons curry powder   </li>
<li>  1 teaspoon cornstarch    </li>
<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
<li>Bring 2 cups broth to a boil in a medium saucepan. Stir in couscous and 1 1/2 teaspoons olive oil. Turn off heat, cover, and let stand for 10 minutes. </li>
<li>Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add chicken; season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove chicken from the skillet and set aside. </li>
<li>Heat remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons olive oil in the same skillet over medium heat. Stir in carrot and jalapeño peppers; sauté for about 2 minutes. Mix in zucchini, green onions, 1/4 cup chicken broth, and ginger. Cook and stir until vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes. </li>
<li>Stir together remaining 1 cup chicken broth, curry powder, cornstarch, and coriander in a small bowl until blended. Pour over vegetables in the skillet. Return chicken to the skillet. Continue cooking until chicken is coated and sauce is thickened, about 2 minutes. Serve over couscous. </li>
